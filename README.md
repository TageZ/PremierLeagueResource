# PremierLeagueResource
A comprehensive resource for premier league information and statistics. 

#WORK IN PROGRESS 

The goal of this project is to create a full-stack web application for general premier league information. When prompted, the application should provide the following information for each team: upcoming fixtures, recent results, top scorers, top assisters, most recent starting XI, and general information about the team, such as their stadium, nickname, and so on.
