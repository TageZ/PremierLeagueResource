# PremierLeagueResource

A comprehensive resource for premier league information.

#WORK IN PROGRESS

The goal of this project is to create a full-stack web application for general premier league information. When prompted, the application should provide the following information for each team: upcoming fixtures, recent results, and general information about the team, such as their stadium, nickname, and so on. It should also be able to provide the league table.

At some point, I'd also like to add individual statistics i.e. top scorers, top assisters, so on.
