# PremierLeagueResource

A comprehensive resource for Premier League information.

Through the use of web-scraping, this application can gather a team's upcoming fixtures, recent results, top scorers, and top assisters. It can also obtain the top scorers and assisters for the Premier League as a whole.

Currently working on creating a front end for this application using React. When that is completed, a link to the website will be provided, where this application will be able to be used.
